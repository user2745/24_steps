Quantify the Value Proposition (QVP)
---------------------------------------------------------
How will the Feature / Benefits turn into Value for the customer ?

Compare & Contrast
Life With your product  vs  Life without your product
Goal: Clearly learn where your target customer gains value ( and boost credibility!)
Current vs Possible 
How life is now ( current )   VS   How life can be with your product ( Possible )
The idea is that life with your product is much easier/better/VALUABLE (and that is the QVP)

Underpromise, Overdeliver 
(Avoid overselling, it only hurts in the long run)




Customers ask: "What value do I get out of this product?"
How will you answer ?
  "Here's how it will make you money"
  "Here's how it will improve your life"
  
KEY: Align the value proposition with the Persona's Priorities and show it to the customer
The Persona has a list of concerns, be sure to show how your valuable product addresses those concerns
