Calculate the Lifetime Value of an Aquired Customer (LTV)
Add up the amount of revenue you can expect per acquired Customer
discount the revenue by how much it'll require you to pay investors over time

If LTV does not equal 3x COCA -- TRY AGAIN!

Keep in Mind
> One-time Revenue Streams AND/OR Recurring Revenue Streams -- where is the money coming from
> Opportunities to Upsell -- what are secondary products/services you can provide
> Gross Margin for each of your revenue streams -- How high are the margins?
> Retention Rate -- How many customers continue to pay for your services?
> Life of Product
> Next Product Purchase Rate -- 
> Cost of Capital Rate -- How much it costs (debt or equity) to get money from investors

What is LTV
The Lifetime Value is a metric that tracks how much value, and how long your customers get value from your business

How to Calculate the LTV

Present Value = Profit * (1 - Cost of Capital Rate)^t

Present Value - The quantified value you bring to customers
Profit - What your business makes after factoring in costs 
Cost of Capital Rates - What your investors will need to recoup from their investment
t - number of years after year 0



Keep in Mind
> LTV is about Profit, gross margin, and cost of capital -- 
> Do not ignore overhead costs -- 
> High Margins make a HUGE difference -- 
> Keep your customers -- avoid low retention
> Upselling can make a HUGE difference -- Selling solutions to existing customers problems
