Identify Key Assumptions

RECAP - By now you have an Understanding of..

Who the customer is
What value you bring the customer
How they will acquire the product
How much it costs to acquire a customer
How much profit the customer will bring 

(If you haven't... reread the book!)

Do NOT trust your intuition or broad research, there is TOO MUCH of a leap of faith

Sound familiar? Think MVP + lean startup. Key difference: You MUST deliver a WHOLE product

How to ID Key Assumptions:

Make a list of areas which have logical conclusions based on market research --

Questions to ask:
> Have you correctly identified your Personaâ€™s priorities?
> Will your customer find the value proposition attractive when it comes time for them to make a purchase?
> Will the customer make the time and effort to integrate your product into their workflow?

Margins
> Are your costs target accurate?
> what are your key development challenges, assumptions, and cost items?

.. and more!
