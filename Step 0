Three Ways of Getting Started

1. I have a passion
2. I have an Idea
3. I have a technology


The passion is
"I am earning a degree in Computer Science, and have practiced founding and growing teams for  4+ years in various games / clubs,
now I want to translate those skills into growing teams and companies"

The Idea is ...
"I want to be leading a fast growing company, providing for the needs of myself and family,
and proving that you can truly achieve anyting you set your mind to."
The technology is
"I have domain expertise with embedded systems, and both web and mobile app programming"

"The emerging (and quickly establishing) market of vertical IoT markets are a gold mine of opportunity and hedgemony"
