Develop a Product Plan


Always remember.. things will change.  Make a plan

What is the growth strategy of the product ? 


The beachhead market is the start of the strategy, but once you reach market dominance,
(i.e. at least 20% market share) and beyond, what comes next ?  Where should you grow next?
