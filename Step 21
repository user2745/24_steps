Test Key Assumptions

The goal is to increase the success possibility of your venture

MEASURMENT OF ENTHUSIAM

To test the interest of lighthouse and linchpin customers, see if they will do any of the following:
Prepay for your solution (best)
Put down a deposit (good)
Provide a letter of intent (okay)
Agree to a pilot (acceptable)
Express a strong interest in purchasing if certain conditions are met (not too reassuring but may be
acceptable)

If you are meeting customers in person, bring along an experienced outsider to help you determine
whether the customer is really excited about your product and will buy it, or is just being polite or
collecting information.
