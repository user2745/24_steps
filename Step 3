Build An End User Profile


Use Primary Market Research to form a detailed description of the end user

ABOUT CUSTOMERS:
END USER - Individual who will use your product 
DECISION MAKING UNIT - Those who have the power to decide to spend the money and BUY
  Champion - Person who LOVES your product
  Primary Economic Buyer - Those that can spend the money
  Influencers/Veto Power/Finance - Significant influencers over primary economic buyer

WHY TARGET A BEACHHEAD?
Your market is full of variety among customers.
They have different goals, aspirations, and fears.
As a startup, the goal is to FOCUS on a key group of homogenous end users


Iteratively work through markets to define CHARACTERISTICS of your END USER

Questions to ask:
What is their gender?
What is their age range?
What is their income range?
What is their geographic location?
What motivates them?
What do they fear most?
Who is their hero?
Where do they go for vacation? For dinner? Before work?
What newspapers do they read? Websites? What TV shows do they watch?
What is the general reason they are buying this product? Savings? Image? Peer pressure?
What makes them special and identifiable?
What is their story?

KEY: It helps a LOT to have someone from your End User Profile in your FOUNDING TEAM
