(Halfway there whoop!)

Determine the Customer Decision Making Unit
> Who makes the ultimate buy/don't buy decision, vs who will be advocating for buying
> Meet the decision makers that affect the purchasing decision

The typical Decision Making Unit (DMU) is made of...

Primary Influencers -- 
> Champion -- Product advocate -- person who wants the produt to be purchased
> End User -- Product User -- person that the product is actually meant for
> Primary Economic Buyer -- person that signs off on payments (controls the budget)

Secondary Influencers -- 
> Person with VETO Powers -- Ability to flatly reject -- seeks to protect existing interests/status quo
> Purchasing Department -- Handles the logistics -- seek to drive prices down
> Journalists, Media, and more!



This is a time tested process that the most successful firms map out and keep in mind.
To successfully sell a product, you NEED to understand who makes the ultimate decision to buy & who influences the decision.
