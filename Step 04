IF THE MARKET IS TOO BIG -- You'll lose to competition and lack of a track record
IF THE MARKET IS TOO SMALL -- You'll be unable to achieve critical mass / become cash flow positive

HOW TO CALCULATE TAM
(End Users that fit Profile) * (Revenue per end user) = Value of Target Addressable Market

BOTTOM UP ANALYSIS
You need to 'count noses' -- get specific on how many customers there are + how many end users the customer has
use trade associations / customer lists to count

TOP DOWN ANALYSIS
You need to 'stare at statistics' -- get high level overview of target market + submarkets that meet different characteristics
Use market analysis reports / inverted pyramid


What is the right TAM size ?

Small
TAM less than $5 million / year
Ideal
TAM between $20 million -- $100 million / year
Big
TAM $100 million - $1 billion + / year

KEY: Keep employees LOW and Margins HIGH
On the Horizon: keep an eye out for the growth rate of the TAM ( this is the Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR)


"The TAM is how much annual revenue you would accumulate if you achieved 100 percent market share."
