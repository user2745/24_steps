HOW TO CHOOSE / PROFILE YOUR PERSONA

> Answer this question:
      If I had only one end user to represent our End User Profile, who would it be ? 
      
     Don't worry about having the perfect persona, make a best guess & iterate
     
Get as much specific information as you can 
      > Person's life ( born, raised, education, family, age, etc )
      > Person's job  ( company, years working, training, managers, salary, performance metrics )
GET SPECIFIC

IMPORTANT - List the Persona's Purchasing Criteria in Prioritized Order
            What keeps them up at night?
            What are they afraid of ?
            What excites them the most ?
            What can visibly go very right / wrong in their work?
            
The Persona is the North Star of the business
(think of Bezo's empty seat for the customer)
All decisions around feature prioritization, 
                        resource allocation, 
                        sales hiring,
                        messaging, 
                        partnerships, 
                        where to find customers, 
                        utilize the Persona.  Keep this alignment going forward, IT WILL GUIDE DECISION MAKING.

THE PERSONA HELPS YOU FOCUS ON WHAT TO DO/NOT DO
