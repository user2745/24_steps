HOW TO CHOOSE / PROFILE YOUR PERSONA

      If I had only one end user to represent our End User Profile, who would it be ? 
      
     Don't worry about having the perfect persona, make a best guess & iterate
     
Get as much specific information as you can 
      > Person's life ( born, raised, education, family, age, etc )
      > Person's job  ( company, years working, training, managers, salary, performance metrics )
GET SPECIFIC

IMPORTANT - List the Persona's Purchasing Criteria in Prioritized Order
