KEY: The Competitive Position is the link between your Core and your Persona’s priorities


How to Chart your competitive Position
Prelude: ID the top two priorities of the Persona 
Next, create a simple matrix/graph as follows:
1. Divide both the x-axis and y-axis into two halves.
2. On the x-axis, write the number-one priority of your Persona.
3. On the half of the x-axis closer to the origin, write the “bad state” of this priority (e.g., if the
priority is “reliability” then write “low” here).
4. On the other half of the x-axis, write the “good” state of this priority (e.g., “high” for “reliability”).
5. On the y-axis, place the number-two priority of your Persona. Write the “bad state” on the half of
the y-axis closer to the origin, and the “good state” on the other half of the y-axis.
6. Plot your business on the graph, along with those of your competitors (current and future). Also
include the customer’s “do nothing” or “status quo” option.

Example:

To achieve product market fit, your product must be HIGH on both margins (i.e. in the top right of the chart)
The goal is to validate against the competition / status quo of customers using their [Persona]'s priorities
