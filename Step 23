Prove the Concept in Real Life

"Once upon a time in a land called Ivory Tower, not so far away from here, there was a chemist who
wanted to make better dog food. He studied to see what kind of food would improve the health,
happiness, and financial and spiritual well-being of the dog.
He came up with a breakthrough formula that was better for everyone and cost one-tenth the price of
the cheapest dog food on the market. Dogs would sleep better at night, have a better demeanor, shed
less hair, have whiter teeth, be friendlier to strangers, obey their owners more, and so on. They had
tested in the lab from a chemical standpoint and were told that it would even taste better. Everything
made logical sense. It was a business opportunity that was almost too good to be true.
He sprang into action, raising a large sum of money and spending $3 million to build a plant to
produce the dog food. He signed up distributors and kicked off a huge marketing campaign. To quote
Jackie Gleason from The Honeymooners, “This thing is going to the moon, Alice!”
The product shipped. Owners put the food in front of their dogs. And the dogs refused to eat the dog
food. The company crashed and burned in a spectacular fashion."
