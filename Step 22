Define the Minimum Viable Business Product (MVBP)

Three Conditions of the Minimum Viable Business Product

1. The customer gets value out of use of the product

2. The customer pays for the product

3. The product is sufficient to start the customer feedback loop
    (The customer can help you iterate toward a better product)

Be sure to keep in mind your business model, business market,
     cost of customer acquisition, and what VALUE you generate
