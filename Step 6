2. How they will find out about your product.
3. How they will analyze your product.
4. How they will acquire your product.
5. How they will install your product.
6. How they will use your product (in detail; see the Satisfier example further on).
7. How they will determine the value gained from your product.
8. How they will pay for your product.
9. How they will receive support for your product.
10. How they will buy more product and/or spread awareness (hopefully positive) about your
product.
The Full Life Cycle Use Case should be visual, using diagrams, flowcharts, or other methods that show
sequence.
